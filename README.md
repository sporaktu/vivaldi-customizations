# Vivaldi Customization
Some CSS and Javascript customization to fix issues I have with Vivaldi's UI

## Adding Style (CSS)
* Open vivaldi://experiments
* Enable "Allow for using CSS modifications".
* Open Appearance section in settings.
* Under "Custom UI Modifications" choose the folder you want to use.
* Place your CSS files inside this folder.
* Restart Vivaldi to see them in effect.
